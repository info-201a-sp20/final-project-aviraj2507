information$overview <- "For our project, our domain of interest is to observe
the transition of standardized tests being a requirement for admission by
universities. Specifically, we have narrowed our scope to analyze the 
relationship between average SAT scores and their relationship to income across
zip codes in California. As an objective of our project, we would like to 
uncover some of the discepencies from area to area and how it affects students'
score."

information$purpose <- "As college entrance exams, such as the SAT or ACT, were
a determining factor in admissions prior to the coronavirus, we wish to uncover
if these tests are a fair measure of student academics. Thus, findings from our
report will reveal whether standardized tests are a true reflection of a 
student's capabilities, or is moreso a reflection of the resources and means 
that students had access to during this time."

information$research <- "The source of the data is from 
California Department Of Education(https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/) and ACS
2010 - 2014 ACS Data(http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--median-
