overview_purpose = "These days, more universities decided to waive SAT
          requirements in their undergraduate admission process. As UW students, 
          most of us have experience taking the SAT or the ACT at some point in our
          lives, thus choosing this topic. It is interesting to see this transition 
          happening and we hope we can find a way to explain such transitions
          with data collected across different demographic/socioeconomic groups.
          As colleges and universities place a high level of value on standardized
          tests, often people of lower socioeconomic groups are unable to access 
          resources that others are able to, such as SAT prep courses. We hope to
          show you that standardized tests may contribute to social inequality as
          they can more often represent one's socioeconomic status moreso than their
          educational aptitude."
