              with 94(Los Angeles Area) were the areas with higher average SAT
              score.The Los Angeles area is particularly famous for celebrities and hollywood.
              The presence of these people impacts the average household income for that 
              area, ultimatley impacting the average SAT score. Whereas, the areas with ZIP codes
              starting with 93(King County) are less populated areas with small local businesses.
              Hence, the average income is low leading to low average SAT scores."

              most of the data confirms that there is a linear relationship between Median Income and SAT score, in some cases
              Income and resources did not factor into SAT performance. This was also confirmed in the San Francisco area when
              the range of scores varied despite having the same Median Income. With the the surge in tech companies in the 
              Bay area the median income tended to be higher which could explain the disperition of scores. As schools tend to 
              have higher median income the scores have a higher variance."
