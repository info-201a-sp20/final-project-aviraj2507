takeaways$summary_table <- "From the table, we can clearly observe that zip codes in the beggining 
(low SAT scores)of the list are the areas with low average 
household income whereas zip codes towards the end of the list(high SAT  
scores) are the areas with high average household incomes and higher sat
scores."

takeaways$first_visualisation <- "From the map visualization, we can see there seems to be a higher percentage
of students passing the performance benchmark near San Francisco and Sacramento
than other places. Students near Fresno seem to have significantly lower performance 
than others."

takeaways$second_visualisation <- "From this scatterplot, we observe a positive linear relationship between SAT scores and 
median income. Based on the trendline, there seemed to be several high schools that outperformed
their expected SAT score based on their zip code median income, as well as some underperforming richer high schools. 
For example in the Los Angelos area zip code (900) the school with the highest median income (86.573k) 
only had a score 1221 while the school with the lowest (21.009k) had a score of 1129. Another interesting trend is 
that some schools despite having the same median income had a wide range in SAT scores. In the San Francisco area 
zip code (941) schools with a median income of around 121k had a range of scores 1725 to 1089."

takeaways$third_visualisation <- "From the bar chart, we a see a linear trend between income bin and 
Total SAT score that transcends all sections of the test. While only a small difference, zip codes
in lower income bins (ie of lower socioeconomic status) tend to perform worse on math parts of the
exam. As we change between the tests, the higher income bins stay relatively the same across all tests,
but the lower bins perform worse on math."
